<p>Hi there! I am Jie, this is my website. I am currently pursuing a PhD with advisors of <a href="https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/3045"><strong><u>Associate Professor Jianhua Guo</u></strong></a> and <a href="https://www.qut.edu.au/about/our-people/academic-profiles/gene.tyson"><strong><u>Professor Gene Tyson</u></strong></a>. This PhD focuses on microbial ecology with financial support of UQ Research Training Program Scholarship. Pursuing a PhD is exiting and the journey will be finished around the <strong>middle of 2022</strong>.</p>

<p>With passion on <strong>microbial ecology</strong>, I have been involved in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&amp;user=s_Uga6sAAAAJ"><strong><u>some publications</u></strong></a>. Such passion extends to coding as well, in the form of <a href="https://jlli6t.github.io/projects/index.html"><strong><u>pipeline</u></strong></a> development using Python.</p>

<p>I have worked in a wide range of different environments from molecular biology science to bioinformatics. The wet lab experience of molecular biology aids in data analysis a lots. For me, itâ€™s exciting to work with different people and to learn from different professionals, these experiences largely diversified my skillset and enabled me a solid foundation as an independent researcher.</p>

<p>What's more, those passion extend to sport! I am currently a fan of jogging and have participated in the Toohey Trail Run 2019 and Brisbane Marathon Festival 2021.</p>

<p>Finally, I'd happy to brainstorm and you are warmly welcome to contact!</p>
