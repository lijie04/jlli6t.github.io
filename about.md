# <center>About me</center>

Hi there! I am Jie, this is my website. If you find anything interesting feel free to contact me!

![]({{ 'assets/picbed/cover/cover4.jpg' | relative_url}})

I am currently pursuing a PhD with advisors of [**<u>Associate Professor Jianhua Guo</u>**](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/3045) and [**<u>Professor Gene Tyson</u>**](https://www.qut.edu.au/about/our-people/academic-profiles/gene.tyson). This PhD focuses on microbial ecology with financial support of UQ Research Training Scholarship. Pursuing a PhD is exiting and the journey will be finished around the **middle of 2022**.

I am passionate about **microbial ecology** and have been involved in [**<u>publications</u>**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=s_Uga6sAAAAJ). My passion extends to coding as well. I have led the development of [**<u>pipelines</u>**](https://jlli6t.github.io/projects/index.html) mainly with Python.

I have worked in a wide range of different environments from molecular biology science to bioinformatics. The wet lab experience of molecular biology aids in data analysis a lots. For me, it's exciting to work with different people and to learn different stuff, these experiences largely diversified my background and enabled me a solid foundation as an independent researcher.
