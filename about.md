Warmly welcomed to this website of **[Jie](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=s_Uga6sAAAAJ)**. If you find anything interesting, feel free to drop an [email](jlli6t@gmail.com)!

Jie is currently a PhD candidate on microbial ecology at The University of Queensland funded by [Research Training Scholarship](https://ppl.app.uq.edu.au/content/4.80.01-uq-and-rtp-research-scholarships). Her PhD topic focus on understanding the novel microorganisms and metabolic pathways for nitrogen-dependent anaerobic oxidation of gaseous alkanes using multi-omics techniques, such as amplicon sequencing, metagenomics, metatranscriptomic and metaproteomics sequencing techniques.

Jie is very interested in microbial ecology study and has participated in a few projects, please refer to [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=s_Uga6sAAAAJ). Jie has worked in a wide range of different environments from molecular biology science in Hunan Agricultural University and Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Science to bioinformatics at BGI and engineers at Australian Centre for Water and Environmental Biotechnology. It's exciting for her to have such experiences to work with different people and to learn different stuff, these experiences largely diversified Jie's background and enabled her a solid foundation.

Till now, Jie has participated in several development projects.

Jie is seeking a postdoc researcher position in **microbial ecology**. Jie is keen to join a research team and undertake microbial ecology studies and **pipelines/workflows/tools development**. Jie also has some experiences in wet lab about molecular biology which aids in her data analysis a lots.
