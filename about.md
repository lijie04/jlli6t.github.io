Jie is currently a PhD candidate on microbial ecology at The University of Queensland funded by [Research Training Scholarship](https://ppl.app.uq.edu.au/content/4.80.01-uq-and-rtp-research-scholarships). Her topic focus on understanding the novel microorganisms and metabolic pathways for nitrogen-dependent anaerobic oxidation of gaseous alkanes such as methane, ethane, propane and butane using multi-omics techniques.

Jie is seeking a postdoc researcher position in **microbial ecology**. Jie is keen to join a research team and undertake microbial ecology studies and **pipelines/workflows/tools development**. Jie also has some experiences in wet lab about molecular biology which aids in her data analysis a lots.
