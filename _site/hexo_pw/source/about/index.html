<p>I am currently pursuing a PhD under supervision of <a href="https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/3045">Associate Professor Jianhua Guo</a> and <a href="https://www.qut.edu.au/about/our-people/academic-profiles/gene.tyson">Professor Gene Tyson</a> with focus on microbial ecology study with financial support of UQ Research Training Scholarship. Pursuing a PhD is exiting and the journey will be finished around the <strong>middle of 2022</strong>.</p>

<p>I am very interested in microbial ecology and have participated in a few <strong><a href="https://jlli6t.github.io/projects/index.html">projects</a></strong> and involved in <strong><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&amp;user=s_Uga6sAAAAJ">publications</a></strong>. I have worked in a wide range of different environments from molecular biology science at Hunan Agricultural University and Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Science to bioinformatics at BGI and Australian Centre for Water and Environmental Biotechnology. The wet lab experience of molecular biology aids in my data analysis a lots. For me, it’s exciting to work with different people and to learn different stuff, these experiences largely diversified my background and enabled me a solid foundation as an independent researcher.</p>

<p>I am eager to continue my interests on <strong>microbial ecology</strong> after PhD and undertake <strong>tools development</strong>, <strong>workflow integration and maintenance</strong> tasks using my coding and statistical skills.”</p>
